# Executing *Pooi*
Pooi has been written with Java, and therefore you need the [Java runtime](https://java.com/) to make it work.
The GitHub repository has self-contained *jar* files in the *release* section, which can be downloaded, placed in any directory and executed from that directory with:

    $ java -jar pooi.jar

Another possibility is to compile the project and execute the generated *JAR* file. Refer to [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for more information.

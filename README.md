Pooi
====

Prototype Object-oriented interpreter

**Pooi** is an object interpreter, which follows the model of prototype-based objects. The employment of **Pooi**, from a didactic perspective, is very interesting for students in order to check the behaviour of a prototype-based object-oriented system.
